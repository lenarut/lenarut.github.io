            <h1 class="font">What does it take to begin a relationship with God?</h1>
            <p>Wait for lightning to strike? Devote yourself to unselfish religious deeds? Become a better person so that God will accept you? NONE of these. God has made it very clear in the Bible how we can know Him. This will explain how you can personally begin a relationship with God, right nowâ€¦</p>
            <h1 class="font">Principle One: God loves you and offers a wonderful plan for your life.</h1>
            <p>God created you. Not only that, he loves you so much that he wants you to know him now and spend eternity with him. Jesus said, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life."</p>
            <p>Jesus came so that each of us could know and understand God in a personal way. Jesus alone can bring meaning and purpose to life.</p>
